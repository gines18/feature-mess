    <h1>Is Tesla totally electric?</h1>
    <p>The high demand for Teslas is fueled in part by the green energy movement. Tesla cars are all-electric, so they do not consume greenhouse gas-emitting gasoline and do not directly create carbon dioxide. Still, carbon dioxide is a by-product of the electrical generation needed to charge the car's batteries.</p>

    <h1>How long does a Tesla battery last?</h1>
    <img class="icon-1" src="./img/download-1.png" alt="">
    <p>According to Elon Musk on Twitter, Tesla car batteries are supposed to technically last for 300,000 to 500,000 miles, which is 1,500 battery cycles.</p>

    <h1>Can you jumpstart a Tesla?</h1>
    <img class="icon-2" src="./img/download.png" alt="">
    <p>Tesla cars normally require a lithium-ion jump starter to get them back on the road; most Teslas should have one in the trunk. But there is another option â€“ jumping a Tesla with a Tesla involves charging the battery with a special connecting lead that you can buy from stores.</p>

    <h1>Are Teslas more expensive to insure?</h1>
    <img class="icon-3" src="./img/images.png" alt="">
    <p>Teslas are more expensive to insure than many other cars because of their high repair costs, which increases the cost of collision coverage.</p>
